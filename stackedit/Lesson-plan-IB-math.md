||Teacher Actions|Student Actions|
|---|---|---|
|**Do Now:** Given the problem situation, label a diagram. State the functional equation for the situation, substitute and solve the algebra, and check the solution. |Teacher poses problem, monitors individual progress and assists as appropriate. Teacher highlights key take-aways and connects to lesson.|Students work in pairs, comparing answers. Students present and discuss solutions.|
|**Procedure:** Applying graphical and algebraic formal methods.|Teacher assesses homework (completion basis, with spot-check of selected problems). Teacher presents lesson concepts: Discussion of lesson concepts. Format: “I do, we do, you do”. Teacher connects new practices to existing body of knowledge, assesses level of understanding.|Students present explanation of problem situation, interpreting results. Students take notes, respond to questions and each other, ask questions. Students complete practice problems, share on board.|

|**Assessment**|Writing to learn: Use proper graphical and algebraic notation in the beginnings of a formal proof format|
|---|---|
|**Homework** Complete Deltamath online problems|Exercises to practice and review; Complete exercises, working 30 to 60 minutes, using notebook, online video instruction and worked examples.|
|**Differentiation**|Open questioning: Is there more than one approach to the problem? How do we methodically create the algebraic representation of a situation? Challenge homework problems|
|**Grouping** Group heterogeneously, seating chart.|Rapid exposure and independent homework: Class at regular pace: \*IEP, \*\*ELL|
