# Written Work


### Technical writing
*Write a short paper answering a specific question*
- **Coherent:** Logical, step-by-step explanation, using examples
- **Vocabulary:** Precise terminology, succinct
- **Notation:** Algebra symbols, tables, trees, grids
- **Audience:** Write for your classmates

### Steps for writing longer technical papers
*Practice writing mathematics according to IB requirements, as per IA criteria.*
**Proposal**
- Define an *aim*, i.e. your goal. Include success criteria.
- Outline paper, especially Method including data collection, graphs, formulas; list references
- Draft introduction, including rationale and aim.
- Structure data tables, sketch graphs, begin formula and algebra (all handwritten, perhaps spreadsheets or Desmos)
- Draft Method section text

**Method**
- Collect data (survey, search, simulation, etc.)
- Work interactively with spreadsheets, graphing software, math
- Refine Method section, draft results and discussion.
- Complete mathematics and paper. Proofread carefully. Rewrite.
- Receive peer feedback. Rewrite.
- Submit final draft.

### Math papers are not just a report. Show creativity!
*Practice writing mathematics according to IB requirements, as per IA criteria.*
**Criterion C: Personal engagement**
- Address a personal interest; "make it your own"
- Think independently and/or creatively
- Present mathematical ideas in your own way

**Criterion D: Reflection**
- Review, analyze, and evaluate the mathematics throughout the paper. Go beyond just describing results
- Link to the aims, comment on what has been learned, consider limitations, and compare different mathematical approaches
- Consider what's next, discuss the implications of results, strengths and weaknesses of approaches, and consider different perspectives

### The right way to **communicate** depends on the situation
*How to send information and follow common conventions*
- **Hardcopy:** Put a note in my mailbox in the office
- **Text (cell phone):** brief, informal, immediate, transitory
- **Email:** versatile, threaded, transitory or permanent (insecure)

    Subject line, salutations, handle@domain
- **Attachments:** .pdf is universally readable. It can't be edited

    Microsoft Word, Excel, .ppt can be edited, commented
- **Link:** extended collaboration, commercial paywalls (e.g. Google share)

  *If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold.*
