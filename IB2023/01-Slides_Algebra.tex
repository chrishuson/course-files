  \begin{enumerate}
    \item In 2014, County X had 783 miles of paved roads. Starting in 2015, the county has
    been building 8 miles of new paved roads each year. At this rate, how many miles
    of paved road will County X have in 2030?
    \item In 2014, County X had 783 miles of paved roads. Starting in 2015, the county has
