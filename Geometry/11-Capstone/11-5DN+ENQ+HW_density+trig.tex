  \item A lamp fixture is in the shape of a triangular pyramid. It is 7.2 inches tall and the area of its base is 11.5 in$^2$. Find the volume of the fixture to the \emph{nearest cubic inch}. \vspace{3cm}

  \item A marble statue has a volume of 1135 in$^3$. Find its weight, to the \emph{nearest tenth of a pound}. (assume the density of marble is 1.57 \emph{ounces} per cubic inch) \vspace{3cm}

  \item The area of the Bronx, NY is 42.47 square miles. Its population density is approximately 34,600 people per square mile. Estimate the population of the Bronx. \vspace{3cm}

  \item The volume of a cone is found to be 414.7 using the following formula:
