    In the high school at BECA we use the Casio fx-9750GII.\\[5pt] 
    It is allowed on the Regents exams, SAT tests, and International Baccalaureate exams.\\[5pt]
    You may use a different calculator in Geometry if you prefer, but I recommend buying the Casio fx-9750GII.\\[5pt]

  \begin{block}{Four mastery standards}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Solve multi-step real-life and mathematical problems posed with positive and negative rational numbers in any form (whole numbers, fractions, and decimals), using tools strategically. Apply properties of operations to calculate with numbers in any form; convert between forms as appropriate; and assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies. For example: If a woman making \$25 an hour gets a 10\% raise, she will make an additional 1/10 of her salary an hour, or \$2.50, for a new salary of \$27.50. If you want to place a towel bar 9 3/4 inches long in the center of a door that is 27 1/2 inches wide, you will need to place the bar about 9 inches from each edge; this estimate can be used as a check on the exact computation. (7.EE.B.3)
        
    \item Use facts about supplementary, complementary, vertical, and adjacent angles in a multi-step problem to write and solve simple equations for an unknown angle in a figure. (7.G.B.5)
    
    \item Solve linear equations with rational number coefficients, including equations whose solutions require expanding expressions using the distributive property and collecting like terms. (8.EE.C.7.b)
    
    \item Use geometric shapes, their measures, and their properties to describe objects. (GEO-G.MG.1)
