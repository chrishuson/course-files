        \item [\#1 - 3]{\tiny HSG.MG.A.1} Use geometric shapes, their measures, and their properties to describe objects \\[0.1cm]
          On problem 1, did you subtract to obtain length? \\[0.2cm]
          \item [\#4 - 8]{\tiny GPE.B.7} Compute perimeters and areas of triangles and rectangles. \\[0.1cm]
          Are the formulas in your notebook? (Notice especially that triangle area is $\frac{1}{2}$ of base times height)
          \item [\#9 - 11]{\tiny HSN.Q.A.3} Choose a level of accuracy appropriate to limitations on measurement when reporting quantities. \\[0.1cm]
          Can you find the formula for \% error in your notes?\\[0.1cm]

  {``Doing your work'' is how math skills and knowledge are developed.}
  Responsibility: Hands in assignments on time. Takes initiative to make up missing or absentee work. Meets deadlines and follows up when they are unable to meet a deadline. Is a positive model for academic success.

  %Completing assignments on time was cited by $83.1\%$ of students. \vspace{0.5cm}

    Satisfactory completion of an assignment requires \emph{effort}, but not perfection. (a score of $65\%$ is usually sufficient) Solutions are posted online. Check your answers and ask in class if you still do not understand.

\begin{frame}{Professionalism: Taking notes}
  Writing mathematics helps you learn and gives you notes to study.\\[0.25cm]
    Students said taking notes in a notebook was the most important practice for successful learning $87.7\%$. \vspace{0.5cm}
