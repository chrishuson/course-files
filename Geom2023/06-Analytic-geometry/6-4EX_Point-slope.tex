\begin{enumerate}


\subsubsection*{Point-slope form: $(y-y_1)=m(x-x_1)$}
\item Write the linear equation $y-1=2(x-3)$ in the form $y=mx+c$. \vspace{4cm}

\item A line has a gradient (slope) of $\displaystyle \frac{3}{4}$ and passes through the point $(8, 3)$. Find the equation of the line in the form $y=mx+b$.
