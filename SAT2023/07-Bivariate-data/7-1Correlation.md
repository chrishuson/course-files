### 7.1 Bivariate data

- Learning Target: I can use scatter plots to compare two variables
- Do Now: Estimate the mean, median, mode of math grades
- Lesson: Evaluating correlation graphically
- Homework: Khan Academy statistics unit due Friday

<!-- slide -->

### Correlation is not causation

- Introduction to bivariate data: textbook pages 133-138
  - Two variables ($x$ and $y$)
  - Independent variable (horizontal axis)
    - e.g. time, distance, number
  - Dependent variable (vertical axis)
    - height, money, result
