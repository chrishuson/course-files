### 3.6 Function curves

Learning Target: I can interpret function curves

Do Now: What are the vertex and $y$-intercept this function? Graph it with a calculator.

$$y=(x-1)^2+3$$

**Test Thursday - SAT no-Calculator section**

<!-- slide -->

$$y=(x-1)^2+3$$

Use this [Desmos link](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/seeud05djh) to graph $y=(x-h)^2+k$
