\subsection*{Simplify expressions}

Simplify by collecting like terms.

\begin{enumerate}

\item $4x^2+3x -7 -2x^2-x+4$\\*[60pt]
\item $3(a^2-2a +1) -2(a^2-a-4)$\\*[60pt]

\subsection*{Solve equations}

Solve for the value of $x$.
\item   $10=x-3x$\\*[50pt]
\item   $\frac{1}{2}(6-2x)=4x$\\*[60pt]
\item   $11=\frac{1}{3}x+2x-10$\\*[60pt]

\subsection*{Slope-intercept form}

What is the slope and $y$-intercept of each equation? 
\item   $y=2x-3$\\*[10pt]
\item   $4x+2y=6$\\*[40pt]


\subsection*{Parallel and perpendicular linear equations}

\item What is the equation of the line with a slope of 2 passing through the point $(0,1)$?\\*[40pt]
\item What is the equation of a line parallel to $y=-2x+1$ with a $y$-intercept of 4?\\*[40pt]
\item What is the slope of a line perpendicular to the line $x-2y=16$?\\*[50pt]

\subsection*{Function substitution}
\item Given $f(x)=4x+7$. Simplify $f(2)$.\\*[50pt]
\item Given $\displaystyle f(x)=-\frac{(12+4x)}{11}$. Simplify $f(-3)$.

\newpage
\subsection*{Graphing linear functions}
Use pencil for graphs. Mark at least some of the values on each axis. Label each function with its name or equation. 
\item Given the function $f(x)=-\frac{1}{2}x+4$. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write down the $y$-intercept.\\*[10pt]
    \item Write down the slope of $f(x)$.\\*[10pt]
    \item Draw the function $f(x)$ on the graph below.
    \item Label the intersection of $f(x)$ with the $x$-axis as the point $P$.
    \item Mark the point $Q (-2, 2)$.
    \item A second line, $g(x)$, is parallel to $f(x)$ and passes through point $Q$. Plot $g(x)$ on the graph.
    \item What is the $y$-intercept of $g(x)$?\\*[10pt]
\end{enumerate}

\item Oceanside Bike Rental Shop charges a 17 dollar bike fee plus 6 dollars an hour for renting a bike. Jeffrey paid 53 dollars total. How many hours did he pay to have the bike checked out?\\*[140pt]

\item Three friends go bowling. The cost per person per game is \$5.30. The cost to rent shoes is \$2.50 per person. Their total cost is \$55.20. How many games did they play?\\*[140pt]

\item The admission fee at a small fair is \$1.50 for children and \$4.00 for adults. On a certain day, 40 people enter the fair and \$85.00 is collected. How many children and how many adults attended?
