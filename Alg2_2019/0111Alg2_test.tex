\item Oceanside Bike Rental Shop charges a 11.50 dollar bike fee plus 3.25 dollars an hour for renting a bike. Jeffrey paid 21.25 dollars total. How many hours did he pay to have the bike checked out? (write an equation first, then solve it)\\*[160pt]

\item Seth's parents gave him \$5000 to invest for his 16th birthday. He is considering two investment
options. Option A will pay him 4.5\% interest compounded annually. Option B will pay him 4.6\%
compounded quarterly.
