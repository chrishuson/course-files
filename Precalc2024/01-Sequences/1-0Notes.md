# Sequences

## Subscript notation

Function notation is more modern and more common, but you will still see subscript notation occasionally, including on the Regents exam. 

Example sequences:

- Function notation: $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(3)$, $f(4)$, $f(5)$, ...
- Subscript notation: $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$, $a_5$, ...

$a_n$ is the $n$th term of the sequence $a$. (we say, "a sub n")

### Arithmetic sequences

Example, arithmetic sequence $a$: $3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...$
Recursive formula:\
$a_1 = 3$\
$a_n = a_{n-1} + 2$ for $n \geq 2$

Explicit formula:\
$a_n = 3+2(n-1)$

General form: $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$\
where $d$ is the common difference, or rate of change

### Geometric sequences

Example, geometric sequence $b$: $3, 6, 12, 24, 48, ...$

Recursive formula:\
$b_1 = 3$\
$b_n = 2b_{n-1}$ for $n \geq 2$

Explicit formula:\
$b_n = 3 \times 2^{n-1}$

General form: $g_n = g_1 \times r^{n-1}$\
where $r$ is the common ratio, or growth factor

Geometric Sequence $a_n = a_1r^{n-1}$\
Geometric Series $\displaystyle S_n = \frac{a_1-a_1r^n}{1-r}$

    a. $a_1 = 150$
    $a_n = 0.2a_{n-1}(0.2) + 80$

    b. $a_1 = 150$

    c. $a_n = 150(0.2)^{n} + 80$

    d. $a_n = 150(0.8)^{n} + 80$

1. Sonja is cutting wire to construct a mobile. She cuts 100 inches for the first piece, 80 inches for the second piece, and 64 inches for the third piece. Assuming this pattern continues, write an explicit equation for an, the length in inches of the nth piece.

1. The population, in millions of people, of the United States can be represented by the recursive formula below, where $a_0$ represents the population in 1910 and n represents the number of years since 1910.
$$a_0 = 92.2 \\ a_n = 1.015a_{n-1}$$
Identify the percentage of the annual rate of growth from the equation $a_n = 1.015a_{n-1}$
