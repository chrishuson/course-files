\begin{enumerate}

\item For the pair of polynomials given, state as ordered pairs $\bf{all}$ the points of intersection of their graphs. \\[0.25cm]
$g(x)=(x-3)(x+1)$ \\
$h(x)=x+1$ \vspace{3cm}

\item Arlenis is making an open-top box by cutting squares out of the corners of a piece of paper that is 8 inches wide and 11 inches long, and then folding up the sides. If the side lengths of her square cutouts are $x$ inches, then the volume of the box is given by \\[0.25cm]
$V(x)=x(8-2x)(11-2x)$

Arlenis graphs the volume of the box along with the function $B(x)=45$.

    \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.75cm]
        \item What is a reasonable domain for $V(x)$?
        \item Approximately which value of $x$ will give her a box with the greatest volume?
        \item For approximately which values of $x$ is the volume of the box increasing?
        \item What do the points of intersection of these two graphs represent?
