\begin{enumerate}
\item Given the function $f(x)=x^3-3x^2+4$. Graph $f$ on the axes below.
    \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=1.5cm]
        \item Write down the zeros of the function.
        \item Write an equation to represent $f(x)$ in factored form.
        \item Which factor has a multiplicity of 2?
        \item Find the average rate of change of the function over the interval $0 \leq x \leq 2$.

\item Tony is evaluating his retirement savings. He currently has \$318,000 in his account, which earns an interest rate of 7\% compounded annually. He wants to determine how much he will have in the account in the future, even if he makes no additional contributions to the account.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Write a function, \( A(t) \), to represent the amount of money that will be in his account in \( t \) years. \vspace{1.cm}
        \item Graph \( A(t) \) where \( 0 \leq t \leq 20 \) on the set of axes below.
        \item Find how many years it would take for Tony's account to reach \$1,000,000, to the \emph{nearest year}. \vspace{1.5cm}
