\subsubsection*{Practice Regents problems \#7}
AII-F.BF.2: Write arithmetic and geometric sequences both recursively and with an explicit formula, use them to model situations, and translate between the two forms.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Given the sequence $a$: 32, 24, 18, 13.5, $\ldots$
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=4cm]
    \item State whether the sequence is arithmetic, geometric, or neither. Justify your answer.
    \item Write a recursive formula for $a$.
    \item Write an explicit formula for the sequence.
    \item Find the sum of the first three terms the sequence.
\end{enumerate}

\item Express the fraction $\displaystyle \frac{3x^{\frac{5}{2}}}{(27x^3)^{\frac{2}{3}}}$ in simplest radical form. \vspace{3cm}

\newpage
AII-F.LE.2: Construct a linear or exponential function symbolically given: a graph, a description of the relationship, or two input-output pairs (include reading these from a table).

\item The area, in square meters, of a pond covered by an algae bloom decreases exponentially after a treatment is applied.
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=1cm]
    \item Fill out the table, giving the area covered by the algae in square meters days after the treatment is applied.
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{1cm}|p{1cm}|p{1cm}|p{1cm}|p{1cm}|p{1cm}|}
        \hline
        Days & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
        \hline
        Area & 150 & & 50 & & \\[0.25cm]
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \item Another pond has an algae bloom that is also decreasing exponentially. The
    area of this bloom in square meters is given by the function $B(d)=120 \times 3^{-\frac{d}{3}}$, where $d$ is days since the first measurement of the bloom.

        \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
    \item Which of the two algae blooms was larger initially? Which is decreasing more quickly? Explain how you know.
