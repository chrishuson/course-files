AII-F.BF.2: Write arithmetic and geometric sequences both recursively and with an explicit formula, use them to model situations, and translate between the two forms.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Given the sequence $a$: 2, 5, 8, 11, $\ldots$
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=4cm]
    \item State whether the sequence is arithmetic, geometric, or neither. Justify your answer.
    \item Write a recursive formula for $a$.
    \item Write an explicit formula for the sequence.
    \item Find the sum of the first three terms the sequence.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
AII-F.LE.2: Construct a linear or exponential function symbolically given: a graph, a description of the relationship, or two input-output pairs (include reading these from a table).

\item The graph shows the amount of a medicine $m$, in milligrams, remaining in a patient's body $h$ hours after receiving an injection. The amount of the medicine decreases exponentially.

    \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3cm]
        \item By what factor did the medicine decrease in the first hour and a half? Explain how you know.
        \item By what factor did the medicine decrease in the first half hour? What about in the first hour? Explain how you know. \vspace{1cm}
        \item Write an equation relating $m$, the number of milligrams of the drug in the patientâ€™s body, and $h$, the number of hours since the injection.
