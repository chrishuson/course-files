# Best practices for personal GitHub repositories

- Use your school email handle as your account name
- Name your first repo \<account-name>.github.io (use your actual account name)
- Use small letters (no CAPS), no spaces, no punctuation (dash, underbar are ok)
- The index file will be your home page
- A [readme](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) file can be a little background information
- Markdown is a good way to format your files (for your file ending use ".md")

## Privacy

- You may use a private repository, a public repo, or both
- Public GitHub accounts are visible to anyone on the internet. Do not put any private personal information on GitHub.
- A public repo is a professional display of your work to colleges and employers
- You can make both a public repository for some work and a private repo for files you do not want to share
- For your public site, use the repo named \<account-name>.github.io
