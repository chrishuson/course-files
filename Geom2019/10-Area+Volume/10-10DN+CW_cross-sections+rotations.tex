\subsubsection*{10.10 Do Now: Volume, density, trig review}
 \begin{enumerate}
    \item Sarah needs to replace two concrete sections in her sidewalk, as modeled below. Each section is 36 inches by 36 inches and 4 inches deep.\\[0.25cm]
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{walk_Aug2018-31.png}
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Determine and state the volume of concrete needed, \emph{in cubic feet}. \vspace{1.5cm}
        \item Sarah can mix her own concrete for \$3.25 per cubic foot. How much money will it cost her to replace the two concrete sections?
    \end{enumerate} \vspace{2.5cm}

    \item The greenhouse pictured below can be modeled as a rectangular prism with a half-cylinder on top. The rectangular prism is 20 feet wide, 12 feet high, and 45 feet long. The half-cylinder has a diameter of 20 feet.\\[0.5cm]
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{greenhouse_Jun2018-7.png}\\
    To the \emph{nearest cubic foot}, what is the volume of the greenhouse?

\newpage
  \item In a right triangle, the acute angles have the relationship $\sin x=\cos 27$. What is the value of x? \vspace{2cm}

  \item If $\sin (2x-11)^\circ = \cos(4x+11)^\circ$, what is the value of $x$? \vspace{4cm}


  \item In the model below, a support wire for a telephone pole is attached to the pole and anchored to a stake in the ground 15 feet from the base of the telephone pole. Sachem places a 6-foot wooden pole under the support wire parallel to the telephone pole, such that one end of the pole is on the ground and the top of the pole is touching the support wire. He measures the distance between the bottom of the pole and the stake in the ground.\\[0.5cm]
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{pole_Aug2018-29.png}\\
  Sachem says he can approximate how high the support wire attaches to the telephone pole by using similar triangles. Explain why the triangles are similar.
