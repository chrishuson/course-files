\subsubsection*{11.1 Do Now: Density \& cost calculations}
 \begin{enumerate}

   \item A marble block is a 3 inch square, 2 inches tall. Find the volume and weight of the block, to the \emph{nearest tenth of a pound}. (assume the density of marble is 1.57 ounces per cubic inch) \vspace{5cm}

  \item Find the weight of a steel ball with a diameter of 1.2 inches, to the \emph{nearest tenth of an ounce}. (The density of steel is 4.6 ounce per cubic inch)  \vspace{7cm}

  \item A concrete marker in the shape of a pyramid is 30 inches tall with a square base. Its volume is 100 cubic inches. What are the dimensions of the marker's base? \vspace{3.5cm}

  \item A steel plate is shaped as a 6 inch square with a 2-inch tall triangle on one side, as shown. There are four circular holes in the plate, each having a 1 inch diameter. The plate is one quarter inch thick.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine and state the area taken up by the plate, subtracting the area of the holes, to the \emph{nearest tenth of a square inch}.\\[1.5cm]

\subsubsection*{11.1 Homework: Cross sections and 3-dimensional rotations}
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item A cube has a volume of 670 cubic inches. What is the length of its side, to the \emph{nearest hundredth of an inch}? \vspace{3cm}

  \item The Great Pyramid of Giza was constructed as a regular pyramid with a square base. It was built with an approximate volume of 2,592,276 cubic meters and a height of 146.5 meters. What was the length of one side of its base, to the \emph{nearest meter}? \vspace{5cm}

  \item A bakery sells hollow chocolate spheres. The larger diameter of each sphere is 4 cm. The thickness of the chocolate of each sphere is 0.5 cm. Determine and state, to the \emph{nearest tenth of a cubic centimeter}, the amount of chocolate in each hollow sphere.\\[4.5cm]
  The bakery packages 8 of them into a box. If the density of the chocolate is 1.308 g/$\mathrm{cm}^3$, determine and state, to the nearest gram, the total mass of the chocolate in the box.

\item A concrete ramp with a $4^\circ$ angle of elevation leads to a platform with a staircase stepping down from the opposite side, as shown below. The length of the platform is 3 feet, and each of the four steps has a rise of 7 inches and run of 10 inches. Find the length of the ramp $x$, to the \emph{nearest inch}.\\[0.25cm]
