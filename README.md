# High school mathematics course files

This repository hosts files for my high school mathematics courses. The Github Pages functionality renders the files as a website at <https://math.huson.com/course-files/>. The `/docs` directory contains this year's courses: Precalculus, Career Financial Management, and Modeling. Prior-year files are in the root directory.

Most of the files are composed in markdown (class slides) or $\LaTeX$ (printed problem sets).
