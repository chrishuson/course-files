1. Scientists estimate that the Pacific Plate, one of Earthâ€™s tectonic plates, has moved about 1,060 kilometers in the past 10.3 million years. What was the average speed of the Pacific Plate during that time period, in _centimeters_ per year?

A. 1.03 $\hspace{2cm}$ C. 103
B. 10.3  $\hspace{2cm}$ D. 1,030
- $$\frac{1,060 \text{ km}}{10,300,000 \text{ years}} \times \frac{100,000 \text{ cm}}{1 \text{ km}} = 10.291... \text{ cm/year}$$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

2. County Y consists of two districts. One district has an area of 30 square miles and a population density of 370 people per square mile, and the other district has an area of 50 square miles and a population density of 290 people per square mile. What is the population density, in people per square mile, for all of County Y?

- $Pop_{total} = (30 \times 370) + (50 \times 290) = 25,600$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- $Area_{total} = 30 + 50 = 80$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- $Density_{total} = \frac{25,600}{80} = 320$ people per square mile<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

3. A furniture store buys its furniture from a wholesaler. For a particular table, the store usually charges its cost from the wholesaler plus 75%. During a sale, the store charged the cost from the wholesaler plus 15%. If the sale price of the table was $299, what is the usual price for the table?

A. \$359  $\hspace{2cm}$ C. \$479 
B. \$455  $\hspace{2cm}$ D. \$524

- $P_{wholesale} \times 1.15 = \$299$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- $P_{wholesale}=\$260$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- $(\$260) \times 1.75 = \$455$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
