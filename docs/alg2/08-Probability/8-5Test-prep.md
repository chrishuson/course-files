### Use a line of best fit for prediction

Given data, a scatterplot, and [line of best fit](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/9kilx9qojk):

$y=1.43x+47.8$

Predict the value of $y$ for $x=13.2$

#### 2 by 2 table interpretation

A basketball team played in two leagues, one against weaker opponents and one stronger. The results of the season are shown in the table below.
| Opponents | Wins | Losses | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Weak | 12 | 7 | 19 |
| Strong | 9 | 11 | 20 |
| Total | 21 | 18 | 39 |

What proportion of their games against strong opponents did they win?

#### Gym class strength test

A group of students is tested for upper body strength. The number of pullups they can do is recorded in the table.

| Pullups | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frequency | 12 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

- Which is greater, the mode or the mean?

### How do you interpret the parameters of this model?

Between 1985 and 2003, data were collected every
three years on the amount of plastic produced annually in the United States, in billions of pounds. The graph below shows the data and a line of best fit. The equation of the line of best fit is $y = 3.39x + 46.89$, where $x$ is the number of years since 1985 and $y$ is the amount of plastic produced annually, in billions of pounds.
