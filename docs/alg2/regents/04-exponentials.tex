\subsubsection*{Regents problems: Polynomials}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.5cm]
\item To the \emph{nearest tenth}, the solution to the equation $4300e^{0.07x} -123 = 5000$ is
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1.1
    \item 2.5
    \item 6.3
    \item 68.5
\end{enumerate}

\item The value of an automobile $t$ years after it was purchased is given by the function $V = 38000(0.84)^t$. Which statement is true?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The value of the car increases 84\% each year.
    \item The value of the car decreases 84\% each year.
    \item The value of the car increases 16\% each year.
    \item The value of the car decreases 16\% each year.
\end{enumerate}

\item Which function represents exponential decay?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\displaystyle p(x) = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^x$
    \item $q(x) = 1.8^{-x}$
    \item $r(x) = 2.3^{2x}$
    \item $s(x) = 4^{\frac{x}{2}}$
\end{enumerate}

\item For which approximate value(s) of $x$ will $\log(x+5) = |x-1|-3$?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $5,1$
    \item $-2.41, 0.41$
    \item $-2.41, 5$
    \item $5$, only
\end{enumerate}

\item Mia has a student loan that is in deferment, meaning that she does
not need to make payments right now. The balance of her loan
account during her deferment can be represented by the function
$f(x) = 35,000 (1.0325)^x$, where $x$ is the number of years since the
deferment began. If the bank decides to calculate her balance showing
a monthly growth rate, an approximately equivalent function would be
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f(x) = 35,000 (1.0027)^{12x}$
    \item $\displaystyle f(x) = 35,000 (1.0027)^{\frac{x}{12}}$
    \item $f(x) = 35,000 (1.0325)^{12x}$
    \item $\displaystyle f(x) = 35,000 (1.0325)^{\frac{x}{12}}$
\end{enumerate}

\item Consider the data in the table below.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
$x$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
$y$ & 3.9 & 6 & 11 & 18.1 & 28 & 40.3 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
State an exponential regression equation to model these data, rounding all values to the \emph{nearest thousandth}.

\item Graph $c(x) = -9(3)^{x-4} + 2$ on the axes below.

Describe the end behavior of $c(x)$ as $x$ approaches positive infinity.
Describe the end behavior of $c(x)$ as $x$ approaches negative infinity.
