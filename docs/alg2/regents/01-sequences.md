# Regents problems: Sequences

1. Write a recursive formula for the sequence 189, 63, 21, 7, ...
2. The sum of the first 20 terms of the series 22 1 6 2 18 1 54 2 ... is
(1) -610 (3) 1,743,392,200
(2) -59 (4) 2,324,522,934
3. A tree farm initially has 150 trees. Each year, 20% of the trees are cut down and 80 seedlings are planted. Which recursive formula models the number of trees, a<sub>n</sub>, after n years?

a. $a_1 = 150$
$a_n = 0.2a_{n-1}(0.2) + 80$

b. $a_1 = 150$
$a_n = 0.8a_{n-1}(0.8) + 80$

c. $a_n = 150(0.2)^{n} + 80$

d. $a_n = 150(0.8)^{n} + 80$
