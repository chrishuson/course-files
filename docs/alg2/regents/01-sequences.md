b. $g_1 = 40$
$g_n = g_{n-1}-10$

c. $g_n = 40(\frac{3}{4})^{n-1}$

d. $g_1 = 40$
$g_n = \frac{3}{4}g_{n-1}$

4. Write a recursive formula for the sequence 189, 63, 21, 7, ...
5. A tree farm initially has 150 trees. Each year, 20% of the trees are cut down and 80 seedlings are planted. Which recursive formula models the number of trees, a~n~, after $n$ years?

a. $a_1 = 150$
$a_n = 0.2a_{n-1}(0.2) + 80$

b. $a_1 = 150$
$a_n = 0.8a_{n-1}(0.8) + 80$

c. $a_n = 150(0.2)^{n} + 80$

6. The sum of the first 20 terms of the series $-2 + 6 - 18 + 54 - ...$ is
(1) -610 (3) 1,743,392,200
(2) -59 (4) 2,324,522,934

7. Given the geometric series $300, 360, 432, 518.4, ...$, write a geometric series formula, $S_n$, for the sum of the first $n$ terms. Use the formula to find the sum of the first 10 terms, to the *nearest tenth*.

8. The initial push of a child on a swing causes the swing to travel a total of 6 feet. Each successive swing travels 80% of the distance of the previous swing. Determine the total distance, to the nearest hundredth of a foot, a child travels in the first five swings.

9. Sonja is cutting wire to construct a mobile. She cuts 100 inches for the first piece, 80 inches for the second piece, and 64 inches for the third piece. Assuming this pattern continues, write an explicit equation for an, the length in inches of the nth piece.
Sonja only has 40 feet of wire to use for the project and wants to cut 20 pieces total for the mobile using her pattern. Will she have enough wire? Justify your answer.

10. The population, in millions of people, of the United States can be represented by the recursive formula below, where $a_0$ represents the population in 1910 and n represents the number of years since 1910.
$$a_0 = 92.2 \\ a_n = 1.015a_{n-1}$$
Identify the percentage of the annual rate of growth from the equation $a_n = 1.015a_{n-1}$
Write an exponential function, $P$, where $P(t)$ represents the United States population in millions of people, and $t$ is the number of years since 1910.
According to this model, determine algebraically the number of years it takes for the population of the United States to be approximately 300 million people. Round your answer to the *nearest year*.
