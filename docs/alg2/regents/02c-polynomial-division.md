Thursday 30 May 2024
Learning Target: I can determine equivalent exponential function expresssions

### Do Now: WNBA basketball player heights

The mean height is $\bar{x} = 72.8$ inches
The standard deviation is $\sigma = 3.4$ inches

Britney Griner is 6 foot 9 inches tall. Is that exceptionally tall for the WNBA? How about Caitlyn Clark at 6 foot even?

__________

### An investment of \$1000 earns 16\% annual interest rate

$\hspace{0.3cm}$ $P(t)=1000 (1.16)^t$
$\hspace{0.3cm}$ $P(t)=1000 (1.04)^{4t}$
$\hspace{0.3cm}$ $P(t)=1000 (1.0378)^{4t}$
$\hspace{0.3cm}$ $P(t)=1000 e^{0.16t}$

Match each equation with its description
    A. A continuously compounded rate
    B. A quarterly compounded
    C. An annual rate
    D. An approximation expressed as a quarterly rate

Hint: Calculate $P(1)$
