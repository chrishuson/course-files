## Prep 18 - Polynomial division

Tuesday 28 May 2024
Learning Target: I can work with the factors of a polynomial
### Do Now: Find the factors of the polynomial

$\hspace{0.3cm}$ $2y+6x=3$
$\hspace{0.5cm}$ $y+3x=2$

How many solutions $(x,y)$ are there to the system of equations above?
    A. Zero
    B. One
    C. Two
    D. More than two

Hint: There are multiple ways to solve a system: calculate/guess, make a data table, eliminate a variable, substitute a variable, graph the system.

### Multiple choice strategies

Easy substitions, $x=0$, $x=1$, $x=-1$

$2 x^3 - 8 x^2 + 2 x + 17 = 0$
* The lines intersect in one point. In this case, the system has a unique solution.
* The lines are parallel. In this case, the system has no solution.
* The lines are identical. In this case, every point on the line is a solution,
and so the system has infinitely many solutions.
