1. A Foucault pendulum can be used to demonstrate that the Earth rotates. The time, $t$, in seconds, that it takes for one swing or period of the pendulum can be modeled by the equation $t = 2Ï€ \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$ where $L$ is the length of the pendulum in meters and $g$ is a constant of $9.81 m/s^2$.\
The first Foucault pendulum was constructed in 1851 and has a pendulum length of 67 m. Determine, to the *nearest tenth of a second*, the time it takes this pendulum to complete one swing.\
Another Foucault pendulum at the United Nations building takes 9.6 seconds to complete one swing. Determine, to the *nearest tenth of a meter*, the length of this pendulum.
