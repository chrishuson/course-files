\begin{enumerate}

\item With or without a calculator, evaluate each polynomial for the given value of $x$.
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=1cm]
        \item $f(x)=2x^3+7x^2-3x+5$, $x=0$ \\[0.25cm] 
        $f(0) = $ \vspace{2cm}
        \item $g(x)=x^4+7x^3-2$, $x=1$ \\[0.25cm] 
        $g(1) = $ \vspace{2cm}
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{multicols}

\item Use a calculator to find the value of $h(x)=x^3+5x^2-4x+12$ for $x=-7$. \\[0.25cm] 
$h(-7) = $ \vspace{2cm}

\item A polynomial $A$ is used to model the value of an investment account. Two deposits were made which earned interest annually.  $$A(x)=650x^6+400x^3$$ 
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=1cm]
    \item The first deposit of \$650 was made six years ago. How much was the second deposit, and how long ago was it made? \vspace{2cm}
    \item Find the value of $A(x)$ for $x = 1.06$ to the \emph{nearest cent}. \vspace{2cm}
    \item If the interest rate earned on the account is $r = 4 \frac{1}{2}\%$ what value of $x$ would be used in the formula? \vspace{2cm}
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\item adding polynomials, subtracting
\item multiplying with a box, multiplying without a box
\item features of a graph, terminology

\end{enumerate}
