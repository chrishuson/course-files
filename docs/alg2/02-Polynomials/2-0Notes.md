# Polynomials and Rational Functions

**Polynomial** (literally, "many numbers", see also polygon and polyhedron)
A polynomial function of  $x$ is a function given by a sum of terms, each of which is a constant times a whole number power of $x$. The word polynomial is used to refer both to the function and to the expression defining it.

Examples:
$5x^3+2x^2+7x+9$
$V(x) = (x)(11-2x)(8.5 - 2x)$

The degree of a polynomial is the largest power of $x$ that appears in the expression. The leading term of a polynomial is the term with the highest power of $x$. The leading coefficient of a polynomial is the coefficient of the leading term. In the first example above, the degree is 3, the leading term is $5x^3$, and the leading coefficient is 5.

**degree**
The degree of a polynomial in $x$ is the highest exponent occuring on $x$ when you write the polynomial out as a sum of non-zero constants times powers of $x$ (with like terms collected).

**relative maximum**
A point on the graph of a function that is higher than any of the points around it.
