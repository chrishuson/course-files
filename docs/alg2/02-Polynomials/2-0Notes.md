# Polynomials and Rational Functions

**Polynomial** (literally, "many numbers", see also polygon and polyhedron)
A polynomial function of  $x$ is a function given by a sum of terms, each of which is a constant times a whole number power of $x$. The word polynomial is used to refer both to the function and to the expression defining it.

Examples:
$5x^3+2x^2+7x+9$
$V(x) = (x)(11-2x)(8.5 - 2x)$

The degree of a polynomial is the largest power of $x$ that appears in the expression. The leading term of a polynomial is the term with the highest power of $x$. The leading coefficient of a polynomial is the coefficient of the leading term. In the first example above, the degree is 3, the leading term is $5x^3$, and the leading coefficient is 5.

**degree**
The degree, or the *order*, of a polynomial in $x$ is the highest exponent occuring on $x$ when you write the polynomial out as a sum of non-zero constants times powers of $x$ (with like terms collected).

**variable**
A letter used to represent a value that may change or is unknown, for example $x$ or $t$. For a function, the input is the *independent* variable and the output is the *dependent* variable. 

Example, $f$ is a second order polynomial function defined as $f: y = 2x^2+5$, then $x$ is the independent variable and $y$ is the dependent variable.

**coefficient**
The value a variable is multiplied by. For example, the term $2x^2$ has a coefficient of $2$.

**constant**
The coefficient for $x^0$. The constant is also the $y$-intercept of the function. For example, the polynomial $x^2 + 6x +5$ has a constant of $5$, and $(0,5)$ is the $y$-intercept because $f(0) = (0)^2 + 6(0) +5 = 5$

**solutions, zeros, *x*-intercepts**
The solutions of a polynomial function are the values of $x$ for which the function equals zero, $f(x)=0$. The solutions are also called the zeros of the function, and they are $x$-intercepts of the graph of the function.

**relative maximum**
A point on the graph of a function that is higher than any of the points around it.

**relative minimum**
A point on the graph of a function that is lower than any of the points around it.

**Adding and subtracting polynomials**
To add or subtract polynomials, add or subtract the coefficients of like terms. For example, $(3x^2 + 4x + 1) + (2x^2 + 3x + 8) = 5x^2 + 7x + 9$.

**Distributive property of multiplication over addition**
Multiplying a sum by a number is the same as multiplying each addend by the number and then adding the products. For example, $3x(x + 2) = 3x^2 + 6x$.
(*Illustrative Math* lesson 2.4 October 23rd)

**Zero product property**
If the factors multiplied together equal zero for a specific value of $x$, at least one of the factors must also equal zero at that value of $x$.
(*Illustrative Math* lesson 2.5 October 24th)

**End behavior**
In the graph of a polynomial, the direction in the vertical direction as $x$ increases without bound in the positive direction and in the negative direction. For example, in the case of the parabola $y=x^2$, $y$ increases positively as $x$ increases in either direction. (the curve is a "u" shape)

Symbolically, we write
$x \rightarrow + \infty$, $y \rightarrow + \infty$
$x \rightarrow - \infty$, $y \rightarrow + \infty$

**Multiplicity**
In the factored form of a polynomial, the exponent of the factor. For example, in the polynomial $(x-4)^2 (x-3)$, the factor $(x-4)$ has multiplicity $2$ and the factor $(x-3)$ has multiplicity $1$.
