# Polynomials and Rational Functions

**Polynomial** (literally, "many numbers", see also polygon and polyhedron)
Definition: 
A polynomial function of  $x$ is a function given by a sum of terms, each of which is a constant times a whole number power of $x$. The word polynomial is used to refer both to the function and to the expression defining it.
Examples: 
$x^3+2x^2+7x+9$
$V(x) = (x)(11-2x)(8.5 - 2x)$
