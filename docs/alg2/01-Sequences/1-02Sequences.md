#### Standards

**Construct geometric and arithmetic sequences**
**Write a recursive formula for a geometric sequence**
  HSF-IF.A.3 Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers.
  HSF-BF.A.2 Write arithmetic and geometric sequences both recursively and with an explicit formula, use them to model situations, and translate between the two forms
  HSF-LE.A.2 Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic and geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship, or two input-output pairs
**Find the sum of a finite geometric series**
  HSA-SSE.B.4 Derive the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series, and use the formula to solve problems.

### Definitions

- **Sequence**: a list of numbers in a specific order
- **Geometric sequence**: a sequence where each term is a constant multiple of the previous term
- **Arithmetic sequence****: a sequence where each term is a constant addition of the previous term

### Function notation

- $y=f(x)$: we say "$f$ of $x$"
- $f: x \rightarrow y$: we say "$f$ maps $x$ to $y$"
- domain: the set of all possible inputs, examples:
  domain = $\{1,2,3,...\}$ 
  ${x \in \mathbb{R}}$ ("$x$ is a member of the set of real numbers")
- range: the set of all possible outputs

### Example: Linear functions

General form: $f(x)=mx+b$

Find:

1. $f(x)=2x+7$, $x=1$
2. $g(x)=3x-1$, $x=-2$
3. $h(x)=-5x+6$, $x=0$

<!-- slide -->
### Solutions

1. $f(1)=2x+7$
$=2(1)+7 = 9$

2. $g(-2)=3x-1$
$=3(-2)-1 = -7$

3. $h(0)=-5x+6$
$=-5(0)+6 = 6$

### Notation for arithmetic sequences

Linear functions form: $f(x)=mx+b$ where 
- $m$ is the slope or rate of change
- $b$ is the $y$-intercept or initial value
