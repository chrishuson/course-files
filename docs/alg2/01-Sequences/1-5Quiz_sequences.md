# Unit 1 Quiz: Sequences and series

Standards:

- Identify geometric and arithmetic sequences
- Write a recursive formula for a geometric sequence
  HSF-IF.A.3 Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers.
  HSF-BF.A.2 - Write arithmetic and geometric sequences both recursively and with an explicit formula, use them to model situations, and translate between the two forms
  HSF-LE.A.2 - Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic and geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship, or two input-output pairs
- Find the sum of a finite geometric series
  HSA-SSE.B.4 Derive the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series (when the common ratio is not 1), and use the formula to solve problems.

## 1. Use standard algebraic function notation

1. Given the arithmetic sequence $f(n)$ whose first two terms are 4 and 9.
a. Write down $f(2)$
b. Write down the value of the common difference $d$
c. Find $f(3)$
d. Write and equation relating $f(5)$ and $f(6)$

2. Given the geometric sequence $g(n)$ whose first term is 3 with a growth rate of $r=2$.
a. Find the second term $g(2)$.
