# Unit 1 Quiz: Sequences challenge problems

Standards:

- Identify geometric and arithmetic sequences
- Write a recursive formula for a geometric sequence
  HSF-IF.A.3 Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers.
  HSF-BF.A.2 - Write arithmetic and geometric sequences both recursively and with an explicit formula, use them to model situations, and translate between the two forms
  HSF-LE.A.2 - Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic and geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship, or two input-output pairs
- Find the sum of a finite geometric series
  HSA-SSE.B.4 Derive the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series (when the common ratio is not 1), and use the formula to solve problems.

## Identify sequences

For each sequence, circle whether it is arithmetic, geometric, or neither.

1. $2, 4, 6, 8, \dots$
arithmetic, geometric, neither
1. $1, 2, 4, 7, 11, \dots$
arithmetic, geometric, neither
1. $3, 6, 12, 24, \dots$
arithmetic, geometric, neither
1. $13, 10, 7, 4, 1, \dots$
arithmetic, geometric, neither
1. $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \dots$
arithmetic, geometric, neither

## Writing recursive formulas

1. Write a recursive formula for the sequence $5, 10, 15, 20, \dots$
1. Write a recursive formula for the sequence $3, 9, 27, 81, \dots$

## Applications of sequences

1. A metal sculture is made from welded steel rods. The first rod is 3 feet long. Each successive rod is 80% of the length of the previous rod. Indicate whether each formula correctly defines the length $L(n)$ of the $n$th rod by circling True or False.
  a. $L(n) = 3(0.8)^n$
  True, False
  b. $L(n) = 3(0.8)^{n-1}$
  True, False
  c. $L(n) = 3-0.20n$
  True, False
  d. $L(1) = 3$
  $L(n) = L(n-1)(0.8)$
  True, False

## Fractions, percent, decimals

Write each fraction as a percent and as a decimal.

1. $\frac{1}{4}$
1. $\frac{1}{2}$
1. $\frac{1}{3}$

Write each percent as a fraction.

1. 75%
1. $66 \frac{2}{3}\%$
1. 150%

## Operations on fractions

1. $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}=$
1. $\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3}=$
1. $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3}=$
1. $\frac{1}{2} \div \frac{1}{3}=$

## 1. Use standard algebraic function notation

1. Given the arithmetic sequence $f(n)$ whose first two terms are 4 and 9.
a. Write down $f(2)$
b. Write down the value of the common difference $d$
c. Find $f(3)$
d. Write and equation relating $f(5)$ and $f(6)$

2. Given the geometric sequence $g(n)$ whose first term is 3 with a growth rate of $r=2$.
a. Find the second term $g(2)$.
b. State the value of the first term using function notation in an equation.
c. Define $g$ recursively using function notation. (There should be two equations)
d. Write down the value of $\displaystyle \frac{g(7)}{g(6)}$.

3. A sequence is defined recursively as 
  $f(1)=2$ 
  $f(n)=f(n-1) \times 5$
a. Is the sequence arithmetic, geometric, or neither?
b. Find the value of $f(3)$.

4. Given an arithmetic sequence $f(n)$ whose first term is 11 and third term 17.
a. Using $d$ for the common difference and $x=f(2)$ for the second term, write and equation relating the values of the first two terms. (you may use $x$ or $f(2)$)
b. Write an equation relating the second and third terms.
c. Solve the system of equations to find $d$ and $x$.

5. Given an arithmetic sequence $47, x, 183, \dots$, find $x$.

6. Given a geometric sequence $\displaystyle \frac{2}{5}, x, \frac{18}{125}, \dots$, find $x$.
