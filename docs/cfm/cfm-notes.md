- A bond guarantees you a higher rate of return than a bond fund
- A bond is issued by a company while bond funds only invest in government bonds

10. Why is it important for you to understand your risk tolerance before you start investing?

- It’s recommended that people with a low risk tolerance shouldn’t invest at all

11. Katrina works for Penny's Pickles, which offers a 401(k) match for up to 3% of her salary, which is \$65,000 per year. In her budget, she only has \$150 per month available to save for retirement. What should she do?

- Opt out of the 401(k) plan since she doesn’t have much to contribute; use the money elsewhere in her budget
- Contribute \$75/mo to her 401(k) and \$75/mo to an IRA, so that she's diversified
- Save the \$150/mo in a bank account until she has enough to max out her 401(k), and then invest
- Contribute the full \$150/mo to the 401(k) because her company will match that full amount, "doubling" her investment every month

- A TDF buys a single stock and bond so that beginner investors can practice day trading
- A TDF is insured by the federal government, so Sam's money is protected even if the fund performs poorly
- A TDF will automatically adjust his asset allocation based on the retirement year he has chosen
