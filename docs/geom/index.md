## Regents Geometry - 10th grade

At BECA we use the Illustrative Mathematics curriculum. Lessons are designed to be student-centered and inquiry-based. Course materials can be found on the publisher Kendall Hunt's website here: [Illustrative Mathematics](https://im.kendallhunt.com/HS/students/2/index.html)

Students use our Google Classroom for assignments, quizzes, and tests. Parents can follow their student's progress and grades on [Jumprope](https://jumpro.pe/).

### Supply list

- Composition book
- Pocket folder, looseleaf
- Pencils & pens
- Ruler & compass
- Calculator (recommended: [Casio fx-9750GIII](https://www.casio.com/us/scientific-calculators/product.FX-9750GIII/) but other graphing calculators are acceptable)

[Routines and expectations](../alg2/01-Sequences/00-Slides_Routines.pdf)
