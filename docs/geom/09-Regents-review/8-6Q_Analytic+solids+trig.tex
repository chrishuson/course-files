\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2cm]
\item Express as an exact value the area of the sector of a circle with central angle $45^\circ$ \\and radius 5. \hfill G.C.5

\item What is the image of the point $(3,4)$ after it is reflected across the $x$-axis? \hfill G.CO.5

\item What is an equation of the image of the line $\displaystyle y=\frac{1}{4}x+5$ after a translation up 2?

\item Write down the equation of a circle with center $(5,-3)$ and radius 2. \hfill G.GPE.1a

\item Find the center and radius of the circle with equation $(x-2)^2+(y+3)^2=16$.

\item What equation represents a line with a $y$-intercept of $b=1$ that is perpendicular to the line represented by $\displaystyle y=-\frac{1}{2}x+7$? \hfill G.GPE.5

\item Write an equation of the line that is parallel to the line whose equation is $4x-2y=7$ and passes through the point $(3,5)$. \vspace{1cm}

\newpage
\item Find the volume of a rectangular prism having the dimensions length 10, width 5, and height 3. \hfill G.GMD.3 

\item A tent in the form of a pyramid with a square base has sides measuring 60 inches and height of 72 inches. What is the volume of the tent rounded \emph{to the nearest cubic foot}? \vspace{2cm}

\item Find the weight, rounded \emph{to the nearest gram}, of a solid lead cannonball with a diameter of 10 centimeters. Lead has a density of 11.34 grams per cubic centimeter. \vspace{3cm}

\item The angle of elevation to the top of a tower located 800 feet away is $12^\circ$. \\Find the height of the tower \emph{to the nearest foot}. \hfill G.SRT.8
