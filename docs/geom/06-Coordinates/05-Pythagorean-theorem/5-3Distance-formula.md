### 5.3 Distance formula

- Learning Target: I can calculate diagonal distance
- Do Now: Find the distance between $A(3.5)$ and $B(8.75)$
- Lesson: the Pythagorean formula
- Homework: Deltamath distance practice

<!-- slide -->

#### Squares and square roots

- Find the values of these expressions

  1. $3^2$
  2. $\sqrt{16}$

- Solve  

  3. $x^2=36$

<!-- slide -->

#### *Principal* square roots

The solutions to $x^2=49$ are $x=\pm 7$

The *principal* square root is the positive solution

$$\sqrt{49}= +7$$

<!-- slide -->

#### The *Pythagorean formula*

$$a^2+b^2=c^2$$

The distance between points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is

$$\displaystyle d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$$

### 5.5 Right triangle situations

- Learning Target: I can calculate distance in context
- Do Now: Two right triangle's legs measure 2 \& 4. Calculate the hypotenuse.
- Lesson: Apply the Pythagorean formula to situations
- Homework: Deltamath distance practice

#### 1) Wire to a pole

- A telephone pole measures 25 feet long. From the top of the pole a wire is run to a stake in the ground 10 feet from the pole's base. Find the length of the wire to the nearest inch.

#### 2) Ladder against a wall

- Lisa is trying to reach a second story window with a ladder. The bottom of the window is 22 feet above grade. She sits a 30 foot ladder twelve feet away from the building and leans it against the wall. Does the top of the ladder reach the window sill?
