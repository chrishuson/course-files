\begin{enumerate}
  \subsubsection*{Start by sketching the situation for each problem}

\item A 12-foot ladder leans against a building and reaches a window 10 feet above ground. What is the measure of the angle, to the \emph{nearest degree}, that the ladder forms with the ground? \vspace{5cm}

\item A support wire reaches from the top of a pole to a clamp on the ground. The pole is perpendicular to the level ground and the clamp is 10 feet from the base of the pole. The support wire makes a $68^\circ$ angle with the ground. Find the length of the support wire to the \emph{nearest foot}. \vspace{6cm}

\item In right triangle $ABC$, hypotenuse $\overline{AB}$ has a length of 26 cm, and side $\overline{BC}$ has a length of 17.6 cm. What is the measure of angle $B$, to the \emph{nearest degree}?
