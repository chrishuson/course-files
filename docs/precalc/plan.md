## IBO Guide - Syllabus hours

Our course is modeled after the International Baccalaureate *Applications and Interpretations* course, although you will not take the IB final exam.

Syllabus component | Suggested teaching hours
---|---:|
Topic 1—Number and algebra | 16
Topic 2—Functions | 31
Topic 3—Geometry and trigonometry | 18
Topic 4—Statistics and probability | 36
Topic 5—Calculus | 19
The “toolkit” and Mathematical exploration* | 30
**Total teaching hours** | 150

*Investigative, problem-solving and modelling skills development leading to an individual exploration. The exploration is a piece of written work that involves investigating an area of mathematics.
