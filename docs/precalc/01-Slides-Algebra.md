### Solve the problem with the partner seated next to you

The class will be divided among the three problems.

1. In 2014, County X had 783 miles of paved roads. Starting in 2015, the county has been building 8 miles of new paved roads each year. At this rate, how many miles of paved road will County X have in 2030?
1. In 2014, County X had 783 miles of paved roads. Starting in 2015, the county has been building 8 miles of new paved roads each year. At this rate, if n is the number of years after 2014, which of the following functions f gives the number of miles of paved road there will be in County X?
    1. $f(n) = 8 + 783n$
    1. $f(n) = 2014 + 783n$
    1. $f(n) = 783 + 8n$
    1. $f(n) = 2014 + 8n$

1. In 2014, County X had 783 miles of paved roads. Starting in 2015, the county has been building 8 miles of new paved roads each year. At this rate, in which year will County X first have at least 1,000 miles of paved roads?

  (Assume that no paved roads go out of service.)
__________

#### Solution

Expressions:

* number of years building roads is $(2030-2014)$
* number of miles of new roads is $8 \times (2030-2014)$
* total miles of roads in 2030 is $783+8 \times (2030-2014)=911$ miles

Function:

* number of miles of paved roads after $n$ years is $f(n) = 783 + 8n$

Solve for a value:

* Find $n$ when road miles exceeds 1000 by $f(n) = 783 + 8n > 1000$
  * $n > (1000-783)/8=27.125$ years
* The first year with more than 1000 miles is $2014+28=2042$
  * In 2042 there will be $f(2042-2014) = 783 + 8(28) = 1007$ miles

### Do Now: Complete the following problem in your notebook

A gym membership costs \$75 to join and \$50 per month. Make a table of the total amount that must be paid after zero months, one month, two months, etc., through six months.

Write down some other questions about the gym membership that might be asked on an SAT test, similarly to yesterday's three road construction problems.

1. Benjamin makes sandals at home. The sandal making tools cost \$100 and he spends \$10 on materials for each sandal. He sells each sandal for \$30. How many sandals does he have to sell to break even?

    Note: financial terminology

    * Revenue, income, sales, "top line"
    * Expense, costs, sunk costs and variable costs
    * Profit, net income, "bottom line"
    * "Break even" means sales equals costs, profit is zero

1. A racket club charges \$100 to join the club and \$10 for every hour using the courts. Write an equation to express the cost $C$ in terms of $h$ hours of play.

1. Jenny plans to buy one video game and a number of hardcover books. The video game costs \$40 and each book costs \$30. If she must spend at least \$120 in order to get free shipping, what is the minimum number of books she must buy in order to get free shipping?

1. Joel sells paintings. Each month he makes no commission on the first \$5,000 he sells but then makes a 10% commission on the rest.
    1. How much does Joel earn if he sells \$45,000 in a month?
    1. Write an equation of the amount of commission dollars Joel earns, $y$, when he sells $x$ dollars of paintings in a month.
    1. How much does Joe need to sell to earn $10,000 in a month?

1. Liz is making thirty shirts for her upcoming family reunion. At the reunion she is selling each shirt for \$18 apiece. If each shirt cost her \$10 apiece to make, how much profit does she make if she only sells 25 shirts at the reunion?
