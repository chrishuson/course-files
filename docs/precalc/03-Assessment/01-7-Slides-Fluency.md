Monday 19 September 2022

### Solve the problem, then compare your answer with the classmate seated next to you.

Do Now: 

1. Solve this _system_ of equations
$3x+2y=13$
$5x-2y=-5$
$\\[1cm]$

1. A local television station sells time slots for programs in 30-minute intervals. If the station operates 24 hours per day, every day of the week, what is the total number of 30-minute time slots the station can sell for Tuesday and Wednesday?

### Fluency Relay Race
Divide the class into teams of 3–4 students. You will receive problems as a team (one at a time). 

Use these directions:

1. Copy the given problem on the board (paper).
1. Work as a team and race to solve each problem.
1. Each student completes one step of the problem and then goes to the back of their team’s line.
1. The next student completes the next step. If the student before has made a mistake, this student should use his/her turn to correct the mistake.
1. Continue through all steps until the problem is solved.
1. Last student should circle/box the solution.
1. The first team to solve the problem correctly wins a point.

1. $3(\frac{1}{2}-y)=\frac{3}{5}+15 \\[4cm]$

1. $-2(3x-2.4)=-3(3x-2.4) \\[4cm]$

1. $-2x=4y+6$; $\hspace{0.3cm}$ $2(2y+3)=-3x-5 \\[4cm]$

1. $3l-6>8  \\[4cm]$

1. $y=3x$; $\hspace{0.3cm}$ $x=3y  \\[4cm]$

1. $3+10x-5=(a+1) \cdot x-2$ 
What value of $a$ will result in a system with infinitely many solutions?
