Wednesday 21 September 2022

### Do Now: 

$\hspace{0.3cm}$ $2y+6x=3$
$\hspace{0.5cm}$ $y+3x=2$

How many solutions $(x,y)$ are there to the system of equations above?
    A. Zero
    B. One
    C. Two
    D. More than two

Hint: There are multiple ways to solve a system: calculate/guess, make a data table, eliminate a variable, substitute a variable, graph the system.

### Systems of equations

The point of intersection gives the solution to the system.

If the equations in a system of two linear equations in two variables are
graphed, each graph will be a line. There are three possibilities:
* The lines intersect in one point. In this case, the system has a unique solution.
* The lines are parallel. In this case, the system has no solution.
* The lines are identical. In this case, every point on the line is a solution,
and so the system has infinitely many solutions.

__________

### What we know about graphs of linear equations

* To graph, rearrange equations into $y=mx+b$ form and use a graphing calculator.
* Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope.
* Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is $–1$.
* For contextual situations, the slope is the rate of change, and the $y$-intercept is often the starting point.
