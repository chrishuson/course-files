|Chris Huson |Lesson Plan 11.1 IB Math SL  24 August 2018|
|---|---|
|**Guiding Question**|How do we organize data using sample space diagrams?|
|**Learning Standards**|HSS.CP.A.1 Probabilities: subsets of a sample space
|**Materials**|Calculator plotting and exponent functions; Overhead doc-cam|
|**Vocabulary**|Fair, bias, experiment, random variance, empirical, relative frequency number, theoretical probability, sample space, event|

||Teacher Actions|Student Actions|
|---|---|---|
|**Do Now:** Given two independent events with probability 0.6 and 0.5. Draw a Venn diagram representing their intersection.|Teacher poses problem, monitors individual progress and assists as appropriate. Teacher highlights key take-aways and connects to lesson.|Students work problem individually, comparing answers. Students present and discuss solutions.|
|**Procedure:** Applying independence tests in a real world context|Teacher assesses homework (completion basis, with spot-check of selected problems). Teacher presents lesson concepts: Discussion of lesson concepts. Format: “I do, we do, you do”. Teacher connects new practices to existing body of knowledge, assesses level of understanding.|Students present explanation of probabilistic situation, interpreting results. Students take notes, respond to questions and each other, ask questions. Students complete practice problems, share on board. Exercises 10A \#4 p 339|

|**Assessment**|Writing to learn: two cards are drawn from a deck, without replacement. Are the events independent?|
|---|---|
|**Homework** Textbook 10B p. 341|Exercises to practice and review; Statistics textbook problems. Complete exercises, working 30 to 60 minutes, using notes and internet access.|
|**Differentiation**|Open questioning: Why do we assume fairness? How do we methodically create the sample space of a situation? Why do “with replacement” and “without replacement” differ? Challenge homework problems|
|**Grouping** Group heterogeneously, seating chart.|Rapid exposure and independent homework: Class at regular pace: \*IEP, \*\*ELL|
